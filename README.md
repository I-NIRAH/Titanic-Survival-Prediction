# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning (Google Colab)

This project predicts passenger survival from the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning models trained on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore how factors like age, gender, class, and fare contributed to survival chances.

## Project Description

This beginner-friendly machine learning project:
- Uses the **Titanic Dataset** (from Kaggle or `seaborn` library).
- Preprocesses and explores data (handling missing values, encoding).
- Trains classification models to predict survival.
- Evaluates performance using common classification metrics.
- Runs entirely on **Google Colab** â€” no installation or setup needed.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Open the Google Colab Notebook**  
     [Click here to open the Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n2nK8PKlN5MagUDitzs0IvltvZMLUCsa?usp=sharing)  
   

2. **Upload the Dataset**  
   You can download the dataset from [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)  
   Upload the `train.csv` file in Colab when prompted.

3. **Run All Cells**  
   The notebook will:
   - Load and clean the data
   - Train a model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest)
   - Show accuracy, confusion matrix, and predictions

## Sample Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree (optional)

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Score (optional)
